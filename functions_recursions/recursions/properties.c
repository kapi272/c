// properties of recursive functions
// 1. A recursive function must have a base case.
// 2. Recursive functions can be less efficient than iterative functions.
// 3. Each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack.
// 4. Recursive functions can be elegant and easier to read.

/*

i) anything that can be done iteratively can also be done recursively

ii) recursive functions can sometimes be more elegant and easier to read than their
    iterative counterparts and can " lead to simpler code "

iii) BASE CASES are essential in recursive functions to prevent infinite recursion
    and stack overflow errors (base function stops recursion)


iv) recursive functions can be less efficient than iterative functions due to the overhead
    of multiple function calls and maintaining the call stack

v) iteration have infinite loops & recursive has stack overflow errors
